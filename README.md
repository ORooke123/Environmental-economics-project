# Environmental-economics-project

In this project we will evaluate the economic and environmental effects of Chinese demand for soybeans and beef products from Brazil. 

Brazil boasts an exceptional biodiversity not found anywhere else in the world, also known as the world’s leading exporter of beef and soybean, with China being the largest importer of these products. This paper first seeks to analyze the environmental and economic impact of China’s import of these agricultural commodities on Brazilian biodiversity. We will shed light on this by introducing a model framework which establishes a connection between the Chinese imports of Brazilian beef and soybean, and deforestation in the Amazon region. Furthermore, the building of a population model will be used to assess how various demographic factors in China, e.g. its growing population and middle class, fuel demand for Brazilian beef and soybean, resulting in both economic and environmental implications. Qualitatively, we will also evaluate the counterfactual scenario in which no imports occur to identify the drivers of environmental degradation in the Brazilian Amazon, as well as exploring the potential linkages to Chinese population growth.
